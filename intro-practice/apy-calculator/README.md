<h1>APY Calculator Program</h1>

<p>The program asks users through inputs to get the initial amount of money, the number of years for the investment, the nominal interest rate, and compounding periods for the year. The program then uses these inputs to calculate the APY and returns the futre value of the investment.</p>

<ul>
    <li>compound interest - simply put, the interest you earn on interest</li>
    <li>nominal interest rate - initial interest rate that is provided before compound interest.</li>
    <li>compounding periods - the rate that the compounding interest will accrue in a given time (daily, weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, etc.) </li>
